<!--Skilled in Python using packages such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, Statsmodels, SymPy. Experience using Excel and MySQL for data cleaning and analysis, and data visualizations through Tableau. As an inquisitive data scientist I have experience utilizing different machine learning algorithms to gain insights and predictions. Some of the classical algorithms include linear and logistc regression, kNNs, SVMs, and k-means clustering. I have also used neural networks to look at more complicated data, utilizing different architectures depending on the data type through TensorFlow or Pytorch. As a data analyst, I have performed different types of data analytics, including but not limited to, statistical, time-series, and sentiment analysis, using tools such as Python, SQL and Tableau. 

learning about Machine Learning and Big Data, using tools such as Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras and more.
