Welcome to my GitHub repository!

### About Me
- üî≠  I am a recent graduate with an Honours Bachelor of Science (HBSc) from the University of Toronto, specialized in Physics & Astrophysics and minored in Psychology
- üå± Currently I am a Data Scientist at BrainStation learning about Machine Learning and Big Data, using tools such as Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras and more. 
- üßê  I am a natural deep thinker and learner, using data to gain insights and make predictions for your business needs. Skilled in Python using packages such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, Statsmodels, SymPy. Experience using Excel and MySQL for data cleaning and analysis, and data visualizations through Tableau. As an inquisitive data scientist I have experience utilizing different machine learning algorithms to gain insights and predictions. Some of the classical algorithms include linear and logistc regression, kNNs, SVMs, and k-means clustering. I have also used neural networks to look at more complicated data, utilizing different architectures depending on the data type through TensorFlow or Pytorch. As a data analyst, I have performed different types of data analytics, including but not limited to, statistical, time-series, and sentiment analysis, using tools such as Python, SQL and Tableau. 

### Current Projects
- [ECG Signal Classification via Fourier Transforms](https://github.com/chantsin/ecg-classification-via-fft/tree/main)
  - Classifying ECG signals using various models, from simple Logistic Regression to Autoencoders
  - Utilizing properties of Fourier Transforms to clean noisy signals
